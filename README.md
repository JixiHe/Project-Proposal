# Project-Proposal
# Android Attendance System App

## Project Abstract
The project that I chose is an Android application program. It is an attendance system application which will allow users to check attendance in the app. This app has two modes, admin mode and teacher mode. Admin mode will allow administrators to add students, teachers, along with the features of view student and teacher’s attendance. Admin can view attendance as a class, or view each student’s attendance separately. Teacher mode can allow teachers to take attendance and keep them class wise. Teachers can add new students, and view each student’s attendance separately. Teachers can also edit (remove) student and student’s attendance as well.

## Related Educational Goals:
Objective Oriented Design: This project is created with the basic of Objective Oriented Programming principles. For example. Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Association, Aggregation, Composition are all part of this application. Students can get a lot practice on working with those elements. 

Debugging: Although this project is an Android Application project, but we are using Java to develop this app. Debugging for a programmer is a thing that must do. Therefore, students can get practice on testing the code in Java or write some test code.

Design Patterns: Students can get practice on design for class instantiation. Which can be either class-creation patterns or object-creational patterns. Patterns are designed with regard to a class's structure and composition. In this project, there are a lot of reusable codes, so the main goal is to increase the functionality of the class(es) involved, without changing much of its composition.

Graphic User Interface: This is an Android Application, which has a lot of GUI in it. For example, some icons, indicator, label, and text navigation. Students can get a lot practice on editing, modifying and creating them.

Access to Database: This project will allow students to practice on databases, which is who can access what database. And also who can manage the database as well.

## Conceptual Design:

This application has two types of login options (Admin & Faculty), we can add one more, which is student login. 

This application can only allow Admin and Faculty to add students, but students cannot check attendance by themselves . We can design a “create account” for students, so students can check attendance after they create their own account.

Students must enter their student ID before creating an account. 

Students can get classID from their professor which student can add themselves to the class.

Disable checking attendance for the past. So students can only check attendance during class time.

Admin and teachers can see statistics (something like a graph) of how many percents of students are absent for each class.

Simplify the check attendance process so student can check attendance easily

If student come to class more than 5 mins late, that that student will be marked late

More features can be added based on student’s interest.


## Background

Source code can be downloaded in this website and run in android studio

https://projectworlds.in/android-projects-with-source-code/android-attendance-system-app-source-code/


***Building***
Needs to download Android Studio (Support Mac OS and Windows 10)
Needs to have internet connection
Needs to have Java installed

***Running***
Run the “MainActivity” file in Android Studio or simply click on the run button. It will take a few minutes to run the application for the first time. And will also take a while to boot up the android machine as well. So be patient.

## Required Resources
- _Team members need to have some experience on coding in java, so they can learn how to code in android later.

- _Needs to have java installed, and more computer memory preferred. Otherwise, will make your computer overheat or respond slowly.
